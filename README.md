# GiGiHomeRadio

This is a lightweight plugin for OSMC that turns a Raspberry Pi into a dedicated web radio tuner for use with a hi-fi audio system. On startup, it automatically begins streaming a predefined internet radio station.
The system is designed for simple, hardware-based control:
- A rotary encoder acts as a volume knob, allowing smooth analog-style adjustment.
- Two pushbuttons let the user switch between preset stations stored on a USB stick.

The goal is to replicate the intuitive feel of a traditional radio tuner, while leveraging the flexibility of modern internet radio and Kodi-based media playback.

## üß© Requirements

- Raspberry Pi with OSMC or Kodi
- Two pushbuttons for changing the station
- A volume control with pushbutton
- One USB stick with `radio_stations.m3u` file (web radio stream URLs)

# OSMC Read-Only Root & Writable Partition Setup

This document describes how to:

- Create a writable partition (`writestore`) for Kodi data and other write needs.
- Make the root filesystem read-only for stability and SD card protection.
- Configure Kodi to work with the writable partition.
- Use tmpfs for writable temporary directories.
- Control root mounting via kernel command line or `/etc/fstab`.

---

## Partition Setup

1. Create a third partition (`/dev/mmcblk0p3`) formatted as `ext4` for writable data:

```bash
sudo parted /dev/mmcblk0 mkpart primary ext4 100% 100%  # Example, adjust sizes accordingly
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/mmcblk0p3
sudo mkdir /mnt/writestore
sudo mount /dev/mmcblk0p3 /mnt/writestore
```

2. Add to `/etc/fstab` for automatic mounting:

```
/dev/mmcblk0p3 /mnt/writestore ext4 defaults,noatime,nofail,x-systemd.device-timeout=5 0 2
```

---

## Root Filesystem Read-Only Setup

### Mounting root (`/dev/mmcblk0p2`) read-only

You have two ways to make the root filesystem mount read-only:

1. **Via `/etc/fstab`**

   Add or keep this line in `/etc/fstab`:

   ```
   /dev/mmcblk0p2  /    ext4  ro,noatime  0 1
   ```

   - This remounts the root filesystem as read-only during boot.
   - May cause a slightly slower boot time.
   - Useful if you want explicit control in fstab.

2. **Via kernel command line (`/boot/cmdline.txt`)**

   If you comment out the root entry in `/etc/fstab`, the kernel mounts the root filesystem at boot using `/boot/cmdline.txt`.

   You must include the `ro` option there, for example:

   ```
   root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 ro rootfstype=ext4 rootwait quiet osmcdev=rbp2
   ```

   - The `ro` option tells the kernel to mount root as read-only initially.
   - This is the recommended way if you rely on initramfs or want faster boot.
   - Make sure `/etc/fstab` does **not** remount root read-write afterward.

---

### Verifying the root filesystem mode

After reboot, check the mount status:

```bash
mount | grep ' on / '
```

Look for `(ro,...)` in the mount options, confirming read-only root.

---

## Tmpfs for Writable Temporary Directories

To minimize writes to the SD card, mount these tmpfs filesystems by adding to `/etc/fstab`:

```
tmpfs /tmp tmpfs defaults,noatime,nosuid,nodev,size=100m 0 0
tmpfs /var/tmp tmpfs defaults,noatime,nosuid,nodev,size=50m 0 0
tmpfs /var/log tmpfs defaults,noatime,nosuid,nodev,mode=0755,size=20m 0 0
tmpfs /run tmpfs defaults,noatime,nosuid,nodev,mode=0755,size=10m 0 0
```

---

## Configuring Kodi for Read-Only Root

1. Move `.kodi` directory to the writable partition:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop mediacenter
sudo mv /home/osmc/.kodi /mnt/writestore/kodi
sudo ln -s /mnt/writestore/kodi /home/osmc/.kodi
sudo chown -h osmc:osmc /home/osmc/.kodi
```

2. Make sure `/mnt/writestore` is mounted before Kodi starts.

3. Adjust any permissions if needed.

---

## Example `/etc/fstab`

```fstab
/dev/mmcblk0p1  /boot    vfat     defaults,noatime,noauto,x-systemd.automount    0   0
# rootfs is not mounted in fstab as we do it via initramfs. Uncomment for remount (slower boot)
#/dev/mmcblk0p2  /    ext4      ro,noatime    0   1
/dev/mmcblk0p3 /mnt/writestore ext4 defaults,noatime,nofail,x-systemd.device-timeout=5 0 2
tmpfs /tmp tmpfs defaults,noatime,nosuid,nodev,size=100m 0 0
tmpfs /var/tmp tmpfs defaults,noatime,nosuid,nodev,size=50m 0 0
tmpfs /var/log tmpfs defaults,noatime,nosuid,nodev,mode=0755,size=20m 0 0
tmpfs /run tmpfs defaults,noatime,nosuid,nodev,mode=0755,size=10m 0 0
```

---

## Troubleshooting

- If Kodi fails to start, check for permission errors or missing write access to `/home/osmc/.kodi`.
- Make sure `/mnt/writestore` is mounted and writable.
- Verify that tmpfs mounts exist:

```bash
mount | grep tmpfs
```

- Use `dmesg` and Kodi logs to troubleshoot startup issues.

---

## Summary

- Use either `/etc/fstab` or `/boot/cmdline.txt` to set root read-only, **not both**.
- Create a dedicated writable partition for Kodi and other user data.
- Use tmpfs to reduce SD card wear from logs and temporary files.
- Symlink Kodi config to writable partition to maintain functionality.

---

This setup improves system stability and SD card lifespan for OSMC on Raspberry Pi.




## :x: Possible issues

 ```bash
error: File "/home/osmc/gpio_radio_button.py", line 1, in <module>
    import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'RPi'
 ```

This error means the RPi.GPIO Python module isn't installed on your system ‚Äî a common issue on OSMC, since it‚Äôs not included by default.

 ```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3-rpi.gpio
 ```
This installs the correct GPIO library for Python 3.
